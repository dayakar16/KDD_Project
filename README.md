## Introduction
Demand forecasting is a critical concern for every retail business today. Retailers can no longer rely on inaccurate & legacy approaches to forecast demand. With access to a huge customer data, it is all about how efficiently companies are using this information to derive actionable insights. This is where application of Machine Learning comes in. The models & algorithms enable predicting demand for any products. You also get tailored recommendations and can identify fraudulent practices.

While the pandemic had put a pause on the traditional approaches for brick-and-mortar stores, they are placing greater emphasis on incorporating new tech-led approaches of AI, ML and more to their eCommerce strategy. With changing market dynamics and consumer demand, machine learning algorithms help derive meaningful insights from larger datasets more accurately. These techniques help retailers predict the demand of a product or service, uncover hidden patterns, plan promotional campaigns, analyze & accelerate data processing. All this was not possible with the traditional forecasting methods.
